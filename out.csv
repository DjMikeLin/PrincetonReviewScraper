In fact, the average starting salary (according to PayScale.com) for recent UChicago grads is $58,100. The school's Career Advancement office maintains some unique programs to help ensure this success. For example, students can participate in the Jeff Metcalf Internship Program, which provides more than 2,500 paid internships each year throughout the country and abroad, or the Alumni Board Job Shadowing Program where they can shadow an accomplished professional.

					An incredible example of hands-on learning at Columbia, the Columbia Experience Overseas (CEO) program enables students to have summer internship experiences in places like Amman, Mumbai, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, and London through alumni and employer partnerships. An alumni mentor provides guidance through the summer. One young alumna who traveled to Mumbai and Amman through CEO praised the program's ""amazing professional opportunities."" She explained, ""I felt as though working with organizations in foreign countries exposed me to new (and more extensive) job responsibilities than I would have typically been able to perform in the U.S. as an intern. This experience and skill set strengthened my ability to apply for and secure future internships and eventually after-college jobs. In fact, both my CEO experiences were related to non-profit administration, strategy, and capacity building, which is the field I ultimately entered after graduation."" Another alumna, who traveled to Asia with CEO, says: ""CEO was my favorite memory from Columbia! It was my first-ever trip to Asia, and I learned so much about the differences in work cultures and attitudes. It further ignited my wanderlust and made me a top candidate at future jobs to travel, because they saw I was able to deliver when stationed abroad.""

					Students agree that Stanford ""provides a great opportunity to pursue greater careers with a wide array of resources and support.""  For one, with a sponsored research budget of over $1.22 billion, Stanford's huge research program ensures someone on campus is always making something new. DoResearch is Stanford's online platform that helps student get organized and get started on whatever projects they can dream up. UAR (Undergraduate Advising and Research) connects students with faculty members studying or undertaking similar research or creative projects and provides $5.4 million to fund 1,074 student projects. And even though the school is surrounded by Silicon Valley, that doesn't alter the stellar arts and humanities programs. In fact, the university recently finished a new building for the Department of Art and Art History, which is part of a new ""arts district"" on campus. Even while the largest majors are in the sciences and engineering, the university ""considers exposure to the arts crucial to a liberal arts education."" From the stunning acoustics in Bing Concert Hall to the presentation practices in the Hume Center for Writing and Speaking, students have a chance to receive a great arts education at Stanford, too.  A 2015 grad in bioengineering sums it up: ""Stanford's given me the opportunity to go abroad three times as an engineer, to minor in modern languages, to explore classics and religious studies, while simultaneously excelling at the cutting edge of the world's finest bioengineering technology…with a relaxed and supportive social atmosphere. That's something that makes me feel incredibly lucky on a daily basis.""

					Duke University understands that companies, organizations, and governments are looking for graduates who have training and experience tackling real-life, complex issues. Bass Connections offers these crucial experiences by bringing together Duke faculty and students from across the university to take on societal problems. Alumna Allison Donnelly explains, ""I was part of the inaugural year for Bass Connections, which funded twenty-five or so research teams to explore issues related to one of five interdisciplinary themes (like energy or global health). My team was led by three professors from two schools and consisted of a law student, a graduate student in math/data science, and myself. I was the lead author on our eventual published paper, and we also presented our research to the Environmental Protection Agency, which was a pretty thrilling experience."" Bass Connections themes are aligned with Duke's top interdisciplinary institutes and initiatives. Each theme runs a project team, interdisciplinary courses, co-curricular activities and faculty-mentored student research experiences. For example, one team working within the Information, Society & Culture theme will create a digital archive of historic North Carolina folk music that was previously inaccessible to the public. The team will draw from students across the university with backgrounds in music, history, and folklore and/or with skills in documentary video production and editing, web design, data visualization, multimedia authorship and engineering.

A bursting job board (with over 13,000 individual position postings), trips to New York City and Washington D.C. to learn about organizations and industries, as well as hundreds of employer information sessions give students tons of chances to network and research fields. One neat perk: along with other offices like Civic House, Kelly Writers House, and Penn Global, Career Services provides funding to finance research and unpaid (or lowly paid) summer internships. Career days a year bring over 600 employers to campus (Amazon, IBM, and Bloomberg, to name a few), and PennApps, a weekend long “hackathon” for student developers, draws prospective employers like Intel and Microsoft for sponsorship and presentations. Alumni mentoring is also available to help students find their path. Penn grads who visited PayScale.com report median starting salaries of $68,100.","

After all, when the average starting salary for graduates is $63,200 (according to PayScale.com), you know the school is doing something right. The Career Center truly bends over backwards to help students prepare for the job market. With Career Academies in arts, media, and marketing; consulting; finance; health sciences; nonprofit and government; and STEM and innovation, the Career Center provides students with employer connections and industry specific knowledge. Impressively, undergrads can request customized workshops on any career-related topic they deem important. They can also participate in programs and internships during intersession, the university's winter semester. Locally, some popular internships are at Baltimore-based Under Armour as well as T. Rowe Price and the Baltimore Sun newspaper. In addition, undergrads can receive more traditional guidance such as resume and cover letter writing, mock interviews, and networking opportunities.","

After all, according to PayScale.com, the average starting salary for Dartmouth grads is an impressive $66,300. Some of this success can indeed be attributed to the college's extensive alumni network. As one grateful psych major shares, “Alumni are...a HUGE resource; they love to stay involved with the college and are often willing to talk to current students about careers (and many have been known to give internships and jobs to Dartmouth students).” Certainly, students can also turn to the fantastic Center for Professional Development as well. Undergrads may use the office to find funding for unpaid internships, receive graduate and professional school advising and even get help finding housing for when they head out into the world. And, perhaps most important, the center hosts numerous recruiting sessions throughout the year.","

					""Rice is heavily focused on student empowerment,"" a cognitive science major told us, a focus the school achieves largely as a result of the residential college system, in which ""incoming undergraduate students are randomly assigned to one of eleven on-campus housing and dining facilities before they matriculate, and each student remains affiliated with their assigned college until graduation."" An undergraduate studying biochemistry, cell biology, and Hispanic studies elaborated: ""One of the greatest strengths of Rice is the amount of student leadership involved in running the campus. The residential college system promotes student involvement, from coordinating activities to following university regulations."" A physics and mathematics major agreed, ""It's incredible how much responsibility Rice gives to its students."" Alumnus Judge Edward Emmett, the administrative county judge of Harris County, Texas, told us that he essentially got his start in politics as a student leader within the residential college system. He said, ""I was president of my residential college my junior year. We had great arguments about things going on on-campus. The students really do get to make the decisions. The experience caused me to work with people from all stripes and come up with an arrangement that all people can agree to."" Students at Rice have lots of chances to develop leadership skills. In fact, many undergraduates we surveyed cited student leadership opportunities as one of the biggest strengths of the university. The Doer Institute for New Leaders opened its doors in July 2015, thanks to a $50 million gift from alumni Ann and John Doer (both have bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from Rice), and specializes in hands-on leadership training that extends for a student's entire college career. According to Rice, ""The strengths of each student will be assessed and their potential will be developed in a four-year comprehensive, custom-made plan of classroom instruction, hands-on, real-world experience and guidance from personal coaches."" Former Mayor of Houston and Rice alumna Annise Parker is the inaugural fellow at the Institute.

Right from the beginning, undergrads can meet with a Career Coach assigned to work with their specific major. What's more, the Center makes meeting with said coach incredibly easy; you can get together in person, via Skype, or speak over the phone. Students can also tap into numerous online resources, taking career assessments, searching for internship listings, etc. Additionally, the Career Center sponsors a myriad of events throughout the academic year. For example, the office hosts industry specific “slams.” These operate as fun, casual networking events wherein companies pitch themselves to students in rapid-fire rounds and then set up tables so interested individuals can further the conversation. Of course, students can rest assured that there are more traditional career fairs as well.","

Nashville International Airport is approximately 10 miles from campus and taxis and rental cars are available. Capitol Limousines also provides service to Vanderbilt and area hotels with a call prior to your arrival (615-883-6777). Greyhound buses serve Nashville, and taxis to campus are available at the bus station.

Driving Instructions to Campus:
From the north, take I-65 to I-40 E.; from I-40 take Exit 209B. Turn right on Broadway (U.S. 70 S.). Follow Broadway and veer right to West End Ave. Continue on West End to 23 Ave. Undergraduate Admissions is located on the right. From the east or south, take I-40 W. to Exit 209A. Turn left on Broadway and follow preceding directions from there. From the west, take I-40 E. to Exit 209B. Turn right on Broadway and follow preceding directions from there.

Local Accommodations:
Several choices are within walking distance of the university. The most expensive (the special rate for university visitors is at the high end of the moderate range) is Loews Vanderbilt Hotel (2100 West End Ave.; 615-320-1700, or 800-336-3335) which is across the street from campus. At the Hampton Inn (1919 West End Ave.; 615-329-1144 or 800-426-7866), you can get a cheap double room. Rates are a bit higher at the Holiday Inn Vanderbilt (2613 West End Ave.; 615-327-4707 or 800-663-4427), which has a pool and fitness room. We like the all-suite Hermitage Hotel (231 6th Ave. North; 615-244-3121 or 800-251-1908), about a 5-minute drive from the university. Built in 1910, the hotel has been beautifully restored, but rates are expensive. The new Homewood Suites (2400 West End; 615-340-8000) has an indoor pool and fitness center."

					Every faculty member and administrator we asked about career preparation at WashU could easily rattle off the success stories of their former students. There's Laura Javier, a designer at Facebook who was recently named one of 2016's most creative people in business for her work on Facebook's Moments application. The 2011 graduate credits WashU's communication design program and two specific mentors with the success she's had early in her career. Jim McKelvey, who graduated in 1987 with degrees in computer science and economics is co-founder of Square, the credit card processor that allows businesses to take cards anywhere. McKelvey also founded LaunchCode, which opens doors to technology jobs through education, training, and placement. LaunchCode, located in St. Louis, often hires WashU students as interns. Aaron Samuels says WashU taught him that ""picking a career path didn't mean choosing one part of [himself]."" Samuels, who graduated in 2011 with degrees in business administration and philosophy has always had varied interests, and his post-graduation positions have been just as varied—on Wall Street, in poetry, and as a tech company co-founder. And 2015 graduate Danica Yu is working as a recruiting coordinator at Google Inc. Yu's degrees are in environmental policy and anthropology, and her experience during college was primarily in the field of sustainability. She demonstrates that a WashU education will get you far, regardless of what it is you study here.  A chemistry major sums it up: ""WashU prepares you for a variety of different careers. It's not just good at being a pre-med school. You have options in business, art, architecture, and engineering...It prepares you to think critically and handle a variety of situations.""

Subways (the Rosslyn station on the Metro Blue Line is a half-hour walk) all travel to campus from the airport. If you fly to Dulles International Airport, you can take the Washington Flyer limousine to many downtown hotels and then reach campus by taxi. (Taxis all the way from Dulles to campus are very expensive.) Amtrak train service arrives at Union Station in Washington; from there, take a taxi or the Metro Red Line to DuPont Circle and transfer to the G-2 bus to campus (37th and O Sts. N.W.). Greyhound buses also serve Washington.

Driving Instructions to Campus:
From the north, take I-95 S. and exit to I-495 W. (the Capital Beltway). Follow I-495 W. to the George Washington Memorial Pkwy. Follow the parkway toward Washington and exit onto Key Bridge. Cross the bridge, and turn right on M St.; then turn left on 33rd St., and left again on Prospect St. Prospect ends at the entrance to the university's parking lot #3. From the west, take the Pennsylvania Tpke. east to Exit 12 (Breezewood). Follow I-70 S. to Frederick where Rte. 270 S. begins. Proceed on 270 toward Washington. When 270 intersects with I-495 (Capital Beltway), keep right and follow I-495 toward Northern Virginia and the George Washington Memorial Pkwy. Follow the preceding directions from that point. From the south, take I-95 N. to I-395 N. Exit I-395 to Virginia Rte. 27 (Washington Boulevard) headed north and east. Watch carefully for signs to Rosslyn and the Key Bridge. Cross the Key Bridge and follow the above directions from the north.

Local Accommodations:
A very popular, convenient place is the on-campus Georgetown University Guesthouse (3800 Reservoir Rd.; 202-687-3200). Nearby Georgetown Holiday Inn (2101 Wisconsin Ave. N.W.; 202-338-4600) has special rates for students and their families (though they're not always available). Our choice is the Georgetown Inn (1310 Wisconsin Ave. N.W.; 202-333-8900 or 800-424-2979). Within walking distance (6 blocks) of campus, this moderately expensive place has a special countrified charm. A glitzy alternative is the Marriott Key Bridge (1401 Lee Hwy., Arlington, VA; 703-524-6400). Moderate prices, a pool and health club, and views that overlook the Potomac are its finer points. Kalorama Guesthouse (1854 Mintwood Pl.; 202-667-6369) is an interesting possibility. Rates range from inexpensive to moderate. The atmosphere is personal, and it's but a Stone's throw to the Metro."

					The University of Southern California has advanced research equipment and laboratories, and the university says: ""They often rival those found in professional settings. From our fMRI scanner to motion capture stages to computer and multimedia labs, students find they have all the resources they need without ever leaving campus."" Two distinctive research programs, the Summer Undergraduate Research Fund (SURF) and Student Opportunities for Academic Research (SOAR) allow students in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences to conduct research in the top labs with USC's world-renowned faculty. USC also offers research opportunities in the form of study abroad, service learning, leadership opportunities, conservatory and creative projects. And Directed Research ""is student-proposed, faculty-supervised research"" available in every academic field from theatre to Slavic languages. Students can count their directed research as elective credit, or, depending on the major, student-directed research may be a requirement for graduation. This offers students control over their research topic while benefiting from the mentorship of a USC faculty member. Open to all undergraduates, the Provost's Undergraduate Research Fellowships provide funding to support undergraduates in their independent research. Students who conduct original research are also eligible to become Discovery Scholars, a distinction the university grants to recognize ""students who excel in the classroom and display the ability to create exceptional new scholarship or artistic works."" The commendation is an official honor from the university and looks great on a résumé or academic CV.

This is a common sentiment among Tufts students. The university's reputation and proximity to Boston provide students with many opportunities to get a head start on their post-college careers. The “great alumni network” also helps students find “jobs or internships after college.” The school frequently holds events like the Career Carnival and Tufts Career Fair along with consulting sessions. Fully 91 percent of the Class of 2013 had found full-time employment or were in graduate school by 2014. The website PayScale.com reports an average starting salary of $60,400 for Tufts grads and an average mid-career salary of $120,200.","

Local Accommodations:
A Cambridge House (2218 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge; 617-491-6300 or 800-232-9989) is an elegant turn-of-the-century colonial. Most, though not all, of the rooms share baths. Rates are moderate to very expensive and higher during the summer than during the rest of the year. The price includes a full breakfast and refreshments in the afternoon. Cambridge House also has a referral service to bed-and-breakfasts in the area. Susse Chalet (211 Concord Tpke., Cambridge; 617-661-7800) is inexpensive and a scant 2 miles from campus. Days Inn (19 Commerce Way, Woburn; 617-935-0039) is also close to campus, and has an indoor swimming pool and a restaurant.

					Ranging from traditional intensive language study to global health and development projects, more than 3,600 University of Michigan Wolverines travel abroad each year. The Center for Global and Intercultural Study (CGIS) is geared toward undergraduates who want to study abroad for a summer or even a year. Through the Global Intercultural Experiences for Undergraduates, CGIS offers learning opportunities that allow a team of students and faculty to travel to field sites as close as Detroit and as far away as Oaxaca, México; Lushoto, Tanzania; and Cusco, Peru. Students learn how to lead in a group, work very closely with a faculty member, and see firsthand some of the ""national, political, social, and economic issues"" they've been studying. International Programs in Engineering offer experiences tailored to the needs of their students, with some 500 engineering students engaged each year, and Ross Global Initiatives supports more than 800 business students engaging in action-based projects all over the globe. All in all, more than sixty-five foreign languages are taught at Michigan, which is a top school for Fulbright recipients and Peace Corps Volunteers.

					At Wake Forest, ""Students are starting as first years and sophomores and building their own futures,"" counseling professor Heidi Robinson explains. ""They are entrepreneurs of their own careers."" A communications major we surveyed confirms the school's focus on the future: ""The career center is nationally known to be one of the best, and for a school this size, that's incredible. The resources that are available there almost guarantee you the best internships and jobs."" This is not hyperbole: by six months after graduation, 98 percent of the class of 2015 were either employed or in graduate school. The university's radical rethinking of the college to career experience, veering from the outdated notion of ""career services"" into a comprehensive and holistic four-year approach, has made it a national leader in this field, enthusiastically covered by national news and higher education media. The program of for-credit college-to-career courses better prepares students for life and work after college, in a variety of ways. Students interested in launching a business are provided support and resources via the Center for Innovation, Creativity and Entrepreneurship. The Mentoring Resource Center supports a culture of mentoring on campus. Personal and professional relationships are facilitated with Wake Forest alumni, who can provide guidance for post-collegiate success. And the University Employer Relations office uses state-of-the-art recruiting facilities to build bridges from students in all disciplines to the employers who can make their careers happen. The program offers countless opportunities for self-assessment—of one's values, interests, personality, and skills, via a potent combination of research and exploration. In the process, Professor Robinson says, the two most frequently posed questions are tackled and answered: ""What are the options? How do I get real information that's helpful to me?""

Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro is 26 miles from campus. Call Airport Express Limousine (336-668-0164) for service to campus. The limousine leaves the baggage claim area every hour on the hour until midnight. Blue Bird Cab (336-722-7121) also provides transportation to campus. Right in Winston-Salem, 5 minutes from campus, is the Smith Reynolds Airport, a small commuter airport.

Driving Instructions to Campus:
From I-40 E., take the Wake Forest University/Silas Creek Pkwy. exit; proceed north on the Pkwy., which will bring you to the Reynolda Rd. entrance to the university. From I-40 W., take the Cherry St. exit, which will bring you to University Pkwy. Take the Pkwy. to the university entrance. From U.S. Rte. 52 S., exit to University Pkwy. and follow the Pkwy. to the university entrance. From U.S. Rte. 52 N., exit to I-40 W. and follow preceding directions from there.

Local Accommodations:
A very popular place to stay is the university-owned Graylyn International Conference Center (1900 Reynolda Rd.; 336-758-2600), within a mile of Wake Forest. Ask for the special rate for university visitors and advise them in advance if you would like to have meals provided. Two inexpensive choices are close to campus. The Courtyard by Marriott (3111 University Pkwy.; 336-727-1277) is 2 miles away. The other, priced slightly higher, is the Ramada Plaza (3050 University Pkwy.; 336-723-2911), about 6 blocks away. They both offer a fitness room and pool. Brookstown Inn (200 Brookstown Ave.; 336-725-1120), 10 minutes from campus, is a restoration of an 1837 cotton mill listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The moderate price includes continental breakfast and wine and cheese in the afternoon. For a little more glitz try the Adam's Mark Winston Plaza (425 N. Cherry St.; 336-725-3500), a fairly expensive hotel with an indoor pool and full fitness center. For a change of pace, the Colonel Ludlow Bed and Breakfast Inn, located close to Old Salem (a restored 1700s Moravian village), offers rates that include breakfast and range from moderate to expensive. The Inn is located at Summit and W. 5th Streets; 336-777-1887."

The following guidelines are provided to ensure that documentation is appropriate to verify eligibility and support requests for reasonable accommodations.

    1. Testing must be current
    Specifically this means that the testing must be conducted within the last four years.  Because the provision of all reasonable accommodations and services is based upon assessment of the current impact of the student's disabilities on his/her academic performance, it is in the student's best interest to provide recent and appropriate documentation.

    2. Testing must be comprehensive
    Testing must reflect the student's present levels of aptitude, achievement and information processing. Tests used must be technically sound (i.e. statistically reliable and valid) and standardized for use with an adult population. Actual test scores must be provided. Standard scores and/or percentiles are acceptable. It is not acceptable to administer only one test for the purpose of diagnosis.

    3. Qualifications of Evaluator
    Trained and certified learning disability specialists and/or licensed psychologists may conduct the assessment. Diagnostic reports must include the names, title, and professional credentials of the evaluators, as well as the date(s) of the testing.

    4. Specific LD must be diagnosed
    There must be clear and specific evidence of a learning disability. ""Individual learning styles"" and ""learning differences"" in and of themselves do not constitute a learning disability.

    5. Educational Recommendations
    Educational recommendations regarding the impact of the disability and accommodations recommended at the post-secondary level must be included.

          6. Additional Documentations (if applicable):

                1.   Proof of high school accommodation(s):  504 / IEP / Other

                2.   Proof of standardized testing accommodation (s):  College Board / ACT","Documentation for ADHD must be no older than four years and provide information regarding the onset, longevity, and severity of the symptoms, as well as the specifics of describing how it has interfered with educational achievement. It must include an in-depth evaluation including both cognitive and achievement data from the psychiatrist/psychologist/physician who made the diagnosis, as well as specific educational recommendations. Information regarding suggested pharmacological interventions should be made as well.  Please submit additional documentation(s) if applicable:  Proof of high school accommodation(s): 504 / IEP / Other, and proof of standardized testing accommodation(s):  College Board / ACT.","Calculator allowed in exams: Yes

					William & Mary's accessible size means that it can provide research opportunities for undergraduates that other schools fill with graduate students. As Dr. Lu Ann Homza, professor of history, attests, ""This is perhaps the single thing which W&M does best: meaningful undergraduate student research with the intensive mentorship of faculty. Such experiences can occur at any time in a typical undergraduate career, from freshman through senior years."" In fact, it's quite possible for undergraduates to leave as published authors in peer-reviewed journals. In addition to capstone experiences within many of the majors, about 10 percent of seniors undertake research projects though the Department Honors Program, which gives them the opportunity to complete an extended research project (over two semesters) under the mentorship of a faculty adviser. Students write up their findings in a thesis, which they orally defend at an annual Honors Colloquium at the end of the semester. There are summer research options as well. One student praises the prestigious James Monroe Scholar Program, through which Monroe Scholars can receive up to $3,000 in funding to conduct an in-depth summer research project.

The office also offers specialized boot camps for targeted career areas. For example, students may attend boot camps based around non-profit jobs or ones centered upon engineering and applied sciences.

La Guardia Airport is 20 miles from campus, ordinarily a one-hour drive, but longer at rush hours. Kennedy and Newark airports also serve New York City. To get to campus from any of the airports, you can take a taxi or a bus to Grand Central Station and then take a taxi or the Lexington Ave (#6) subway downtown to Astor Place. Long Island Railroad and Amtrak trains bring you to Pennsylvania Station; from there take the 8th Ave. subway (IND) downtown (A express or C or E local) to the West 4th Street/Washington Square stop. Metro-North trains bring you into Grand Central Station; from there take the Lexington Ave. subway (IRT) downtown (#6 local) to the Astor Pl. stop. Interstate buses come into the city's Port Authority Bus Terminal. Taxi or 8th Ave downtown to West 4th  Street takes you to campus from there.

Driving Instructions to Campus:
From the north, take I-87 (NY State Thruway), which becomes the Major Deegan Expy. in the Bronx. From there take the F.D.R. Drive south to Houston St.; head west to La Guardia Pl. (2 blocks west of Broadway). Turn north 3 blocks to Washington Square and the university. From the west and south, take an interstate highway or the New Jersey Tpke. through the Holland Tunnel, then go north on Ave. of the Americas (6th Ave.) to W. 4th St. Take W. 4th St. east to Washington Square.

Local Accommodations:
New York University is in Greenwich Village, at the foot of Fifth Ave., and south of Midtown. If you consult a general New York City guide, look for accommodations south of 38th St., which will put you within a 1- to 2-mile range of the school. Taxicab transportation and public transportation, of course, are readily available.For convenience, you cannot do better than the Washington Square Hotel (103 Waverly Pl.; 212-777-9515 or lt;http://www.wshotel.com/english/ws_toc.htmgt;), just down the block from the admissions office. Accommodations are very modest, with rates to match. A 15-minute walk, past shops, galleries and restaurants, will bring you to the dazzlingly sophisticated, new Soho Grand Hotel (310 W. Broadway; 212-965-3000 or lt;http://www.sohogrand.comgt;) in the exciting art center of Soho, where, for a moderate (for New York!) rate, you can have a unique New York experience. This is a favorite of artists and photographers. The rooms have great views, and there is valet parking. Bed-and-breakfasts are located all around town in a reasonable price range. Two reservation agencies to call are Abode Bed and Breakfast (212-472-2000 or lt;http://www.abodenyc.comgt;) and Bed and Breakfast and Books (212-865-8740). NYU has arranged for guests of the university to receive special rates (moderately expensive) at Club Quarters (52 William St.; 212-443-4700) in the heart of the Wall Street District. Slightly more expensive, but reasonably priced for New York City, is the Gramercy Park Hotel (2 Lexington Ave.; 212-475-4320 or 800-221-4083 or lt;http://www.gramercyparkhotel.comgt;). It's close to the university, and the neighborhood is beautiful.  See also lt;http://www.nyu.edu/hotels.nyugt;."

In addition to being academics, professors include “professionals in the work force who bring those experiences to the classroom for a much more enhanced education,” and can become the foundation of a contact network for jobs after graduation. Many engineering students at Case Western Reserve also take part in a co-op, which is a full-time, two-semester-long, paid work experience that gives students a head start with potential employers. Students in the College of Arts & Sciences can take part in a similar (but shorter) experience called a practicum. The average starting salary for graduates who visited PayScale.com was $62,400, and 45 percent of these same graduates reported feeling that their job had a meaningful impact on the world.","

The most popular majors for UCSB students are Communication, Economics, and Sociology. While one Biochemistry major laments there are “basically too many students, and not enough open positions,” other students praise the range of internship and post-graduation career opportunities, with one describing UCSB as “a springboard for the greatest young minds to launch into highly successful research and careers.” The Career Services department at UCSB encourages students to take advantage of “GauchoLink,” a frequently updated database of job and internship opportunities that also lists upcoming career-oriented events hosted by the school or by potential employers. Students are also able to store letters of recommendation with the Career Services department so as to streamline the process of applying for internships or jobs during their school tenure or after graduation.","

From the north, take U.S. Highway 101 south to the Storke Road/Glen Annie Road exit, which is approximately 12 miles north of Santa Barbara. Turn right on Storke Road and proceed two miles to El Colegio Road. Turn left onto El Colegio Road and proceed to the campus entrance.

About 4 miles from campus is the Ramada Limited (4770 Calle Real, Santa Barbara; 805-964-3511 or 800-654-1965). Rates are only slightly more expensive than at the Holiday Inn, and the price includes a continental breakfast. Nearby beaches are a plus, and it is close to downtown shopping.

					A co-op experience is available in every major at Northeastern University, and employers know it—over 3,300 companies at home and abroad employ Northeastern undergraduate students. Northeastern's global co-op programs operate in 133 countries in conjunction with a wide variety of organizations and multinational corporations, so environmental science students can work on sustainable development in Bolivia, and computer science majors can study digital animation at Toonz Animation India. With 95 percent of students participating in at least one semester of cooperative learning, it is by far the most popular experiential learning program at the school, and Northeastern has one of the highest levels of co-op participation in the country. So it is no wonder that within nine months, 92 percent of graduates are employed or in graduate school, and 89 percent of those working have careers within their field of study. It is not uncommon for a Northeastern student to spend three semesters in co-op education with different employers or even in different fields. Getting a feel for a particular field certainly gives students the tools to succeed in the future, but it also helps them find out if they even like that line of work. Karim Sabbidine tells us, ""I came to Northeastern thinking that I wanted to become an investment banker. Having done investment co-ops I came to the realization that I wanted to be in a different line of work, specifically the legal field. I structured my co-ops to lead me to that goal and I am now currently in law school.""

Therefore, we encourage students requesting accommodations to meet with ODS staff to discuss their unique situation. In addition to the first-person narrative, the Goldman Office recommends providing	documentation meeting the following	criteria:
1. Qualified Evaluator.  Professionals conducting assessments and making recommendations for appropriate accommodations must be qualified to do so (e.g., physician, psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or neuropsychologist). The name, title, and professional credentials	of the evaluator, including license	or certification number, should be clearly stated on	 the documentation. All	
documentation must be presented on the evaluator’s letterhead, typed, dated, signed, and legible. The evaluator may not be a member of the student’sfamily.
2. Current Documentation. Documentation should be current related to the individual’s disability. The
following	guidelines are in place; however, outdated documentation will be considered.
a. Physical/Medical	disabilities – within the past 12months.
b. Psychiatric disabilities– within the past 12 months.
c. Learning Disabilities– within the past 3-4 years.
d. AD/HD	– within the past	3-4 years.

3. Comprehensive	Documentation.
Documentation should be thorough, giving a full picture of the individual, not simply a diagnosis. It might include:
a. A diagnostic interview including,
        i. Historical information	detailing     the evolution of the disorder/disability.
ii. Relevant psychosocial, medical, and medication history
iii. Academic history
iv. History of accommodation
v. Evidence of current impairment
b. Diagnostic instruments appropriate to the diagnosis are recommended. 
For learning disabilities and	AD/HD, these could include measures of aptitude,	achievement, memory, processing speed,	 continuous performance, and attention or tracking tests.
c. A clear diagnosis must be	rendered.
Diagnostic codes from the DSM 5 or the ICD-10 should be utilized.
d. Describe current treatments, therapeutic techniques, assistive devices,	medications, etc.
e. Address the current functional limitations of the individual in	an academic environment.
f. The evaluator should make specific recommendations	for accommodations in an academic environment.		
4. Supporting Documentation.
Other documents which contribute to consideration are high school 504 plans or IEPs, records of accommodation on	standardized tests such as the SAT or ACT, previous psycho-educational evaluations, transcripts, and teacher, tutor or employer	reports.","Although	formal documentation is required for consideration of accommodations at Tulane University, the staff	of the Goldman Office of Disability	Services	recognize that each individual	experiences barriers to access	differently.

Another tells us, “My neuroscience advisor, Dr. Wee, is always working to network us with professionals so we can have a leg up after we graduate.” As a core requirement of the undergrad curriculum, public service allows students to apply knowledge and skills from classroom study to real-world projects. Students also have good things to say about the jobs and opportunities that Tulane's Career Center provides. The Hire Tulane Grads website makes it easy for employers to post jobs and find qualified students, and Career Wave, an all day event, brings speakers from companies like Saks, Gil Group, and the NBA to campus.

					At Lehigh, students chart their own course. An emphasis on experiential learning opportunities doesn't just teach skills but helps students discover what they want to do with their education. ""There are myriad opportunities available in all fields!"" a political science major told us. ""Lehigh is known for engineering, but all programs and organizations are extremely dedicated to what they do."" The university explained, ""The Center for Career & Professional Development works closely with students to develop multiple career-related experiential opportunities prior to graduating. Sometimes these experiences can solidify one's choice of major, or create an opportunity to explore another career field that might be a better fit."" For Ashley Pritchard, a project manager at the Friedrich Naumann Institute in Myanmar, this support and encouragement was one of her most valuable experiences at Lehigh: ""I was an undergraduate student with no idea what I would major in, and Lehigh gave me the support and guidance I needed not only to find my way, but also to maneuver between colleges. While at Lehigh, I took courses in the Business School, Engineering, and Arts & Sciences and explored my interests through academics and with professors who helped me map where I could utilize my learning after graduation. In the end, I managed to pick up a major or minor from each! Most schools do not offer this opportunity or flexibility and certainly didn't offer the support."" Through study abroad and internship opportunities, Pritchard, who double majored in economics and political science and minored in engineering, explained, ""I was awakened to a larger world—and one that I would later go on to explore myself! My best experiences at Lehigh were those that taught me the life lessons that have distinguished me from other colleagues ‘in the real world,' and provided me with the opportunity to excel in my professional career.""

					The Teaching + Learning Commons at UC San Diego is both a physical space on campus and a curricular effort. Both are focused on empowering successful graduates who can quickly distinguish themselves and advance in the workplace. We spoke with Dr. Gabriele Wienhausen, the inaugural faculty director who was responsible for the launch of The Commons. Dr. Wienhausen explains that the Teaching + Learning Commons recognizes that ""the curriculum inside and outside the classroom are not separate but intertwined. Here we intentionally re-bundle those experiences."" Those packages include research opportunities, community-service projects, study abroad programs, internships, and experiential entrepreneurship. To give a sense of these experiences, Dr. Wienhausen told us about Global Ties, a program that addresses critical needs facing non-profit organizations that would need otherwise cost-prohibitive support to advance their missions. Students work on cross-disciplinary teams and spend multiple quarters on their projects, earning university credit in the process. The Teaching & Learning Commons always gives students different ways to present an educational narrative to employers or grad schools that goes beyond grades and degrees. Students in the Global Ties program, for example, are able to capture that activity and the corresponding skills they've gained on an official, Co-Curricular Record that can be issued along with their transcript. A guiding philosophy of the Teaching + Learning Commons is that ""soft-skills"" which students can transfer to the workplace, like information fluency, problem-solving, and critical thinking, are just as important as developing technical expertise in an academic discipline.

Students requesting accommodation on the basis of a specific learning disability must provide documentation from a professional who has undergone comprehensive training and has relevant experience in differential diagnosis of a full range of cognitive and psychiatric disabilities (e.g., a licensed clinical psychologist and/or neuropsychologist).

A comprehensive assessment battery (not to be limited to an individualized education plan or 504 plan) and the resulting diagnostic report must contain the following items:

    A diagnostic interview—the interview must include a description of the presenting problem(s), developmental, medical, psycho-social, and employment histories, family history, and a discussion of comorbidity where indicated;
    An assessment—for the neurological or psychological evaluation to illustrate a substantial limitation to learning, the comprehensive assessment battery must contain the following domains:
        Aptitude/cognitive ability—an assessment of global intellectual functioning as measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) with all subtests, standard scores, and index scores;
        Academic achievement—a comprehensive achievement battery (e.g., Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery - III: Tests of Achievement), with subtest and standard scores, indicating current level of functioning in the academic areas of reading, math, oral and written language; and
        Information processing—a comprehensive battery (e.g., Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery - III: Tests of Cognitive Abilities), with subtest and standard scores, which addresses the specific areas of short and long-term memory, sequential memory, auditory and visual perception, processing speed, executive functioning, and motor ability;
    A specific diagnosis which conforms to the criteria for the specific learning disability, as stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5); and
    A clinical summary which:
        Indicates the substantial limitations to major life activities posed by the specified learning disability;
        Describes the extent to which these limitations impact the academic context for which accommodations are being requested;
        Suggests how the specific effects of the learning disability may be accommodated; and
        States how the effects of the learning disability are mediated by the recommended accommodations.

Testing must be current—within the past three years for a high school student and within the past five years for an adult.","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Students requesting accommodations on the basis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) must provide documentation by a professional who has undergone comprehensive training and has relevant experience in differential diagnosis and the full range of psychiatric disorders (e.g., a licensed clinical psychologist, neuropsychologist, psychiatrist, or other relevantly trained specialist). The documentation must include:

    Evidence of early impairment—the condition must have been exhibited in childhood in more than one setting;
    Evidence of current impairment—a history of the individual's attentional symptoms and evidence of current impulsive/hyperactive or inattentive behaviors that significantly impair functioning in two or more settings must be provided;
    A diagnostic interview—the interview must contain self-report and third-party information pertaining to developmental history, family history of ADHD or other learning or psychological difficulties, relevant medical and medication history, a thorough academic history, and a review of prior psychoeducational test reports to determine whether a pattern of strengths or weaknesses is supportive of attention or learning problems;
    Evidence of alternative diagnoses or explanations being ruled out—the documentation must investigate and discuss the possibility of dual diagnoses and alternative or coexisting mood, behavioral, neurological and/or personality disorders that may confound the ADHD diagnosis;
    Neuropsychological or psychoeducational assessments as needed to determine the current impact of the disorder on the individual's ability to function in an academic setting—such data, if provided, should include subtest and standard scores;
    A specific psychological diagnosis as per the DSM-5; and
    A clinical summary which:
        Indicates the substantial limitations to major life activities posed by the disability;
        Describes the extent to which these limitations would impact the academic context for which accommodations are being requested;
        Suggests how the specific effects of the disability may be accommodated; and
        States how the effects of ADHD are mediated by the recommended accommodations.","Calculator allowed in exams: Yes

					University of Florida students in almost any field can benefit from taking part in the Center for Public Service, which provides students with research opportunities, internships, and a lecture series. The university told us that the Center ""is a community of students, scholars and citizens who share a commitment to training the next generation of public and private sector leaders for Florida, the United States and the international community."" For example, The Graham Civic Scholars program help students develop an understanding of public policy issues and develop ""practical skills needed to be aware and active participants in our communities,"" according to the university. Each year the program selects a topic that its fifty scholars will pursue. (Past topics have included food insecurity and the aging infrastructure in Florida.) Scholars help to develop and organize the program's activities, complete service learning activities and research projects, and conduct ""in-depth interviews as part of their investigation,"" of the year's topic, according to the university. This is a great opportunity for students to take charge in the implementation and design of projects, developing great leadership and problem solving skills. The Center for Public Service also offers a number of different internship opportunities that engage students within local government and civic service, while providing them with important contacts and future job prospects. The Local Government Internship Program places students in city or county manager's offices across the state. Students gain valuable on-the-job training in ""business/finance, engineering, landscape design, and public administration. Interns will receive on-the-job training to help them move forward on their career path and attain valuable work experience in the competitive economy."" In the Florida Cooperative Extension Service and Graham Center Public Service Internship Program, students create educational programing in collaboration with county extension faculty. Programing areas include agriculture, water resource, environmental quality, and economic development. This is a perfect experience for any student interested in community development, sustainability, or environmental studies as these fields often interact with government personnel.

					Internship options abound in each of the Colleges at Villanova, regardless of major. In the School of Business, for instance, the Spring Accounting Internship Program gives junior accounting majors the chance to work full-time at an accounting firm during tax season. Students who intern through the program can then stay on track to graduate in four years by taking courses in the summer. In the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, rising juniors should check out an internship placement (for credit!) with the Catholic Relief Services. The office is a mere ten minutes from campus and the perfect place to solidify your commitment to peace and global justice. If law school is in your future, internships with Villanova's Law School Clinical Program let undergrads work with current Villanova law students, ""who represent real clients with real legal issues."" Six law clinics run the gamut from Refugee and Emigrant Services to Juvenile Law. And in the College of Engineering, the Joseph DiGiacomo Internship with the Center for Advanced Communication is geared toward students interested in signal processing and wireless communications. If you have your eye on the entertainment industry, then the Los Angeles Internship, offered in conjunction with Philadelphia's Temple University, could be your induction into the field. A program in Vatican City lets students take courses in Rome while interning in the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, the Internet Office of the Holy See, and the Rome Bureau of the Catholic News Service. A longstanding relationship with The Washington Center links students to internships in the D.C. area. Plus, there are plenty of study abroad options in London, Ireland, Australia, South America, and Europe that incorporate internships into the travel experience.

					Students come to The George Washington University to get involved, and there is no better way to do that than getting an internship in D.C. From technology and health to the arts, non-profits and, yes, politics, GW students have literally thousands of options, and have landed coveted gigs with hundreds of illustrious organizations, including Discovery Communications, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), NASA, Google, and The New Yorker. Plus, through GW's Knowledge in Action Career Internship Fund (KACIF), students can earn grants up to $3,000 to offset an unpaid internship. A recent alumna, Elizabeth Edwards, explained what her own internship meant to her: ""I had an incredible internship with the Victory Fund my sophomore year, which ultimately led to a staff position working on the Presidential Appointments Project, which helped give members of the LGBT community a voice in the government through the identification of LGBT professionals for presidential appointments by the Obama administration."" Students regularly cite ""opportunities for internships"" as a major strength of the school. Professor Isabelle G. Bajeux-Besnainou, associate dean of undergraduate programs and professor of finance, said, ""One of the many strengths of GW is the engagement of students in their community and their ability to leverage GW's location for internship opportunities in particular."" With so many government agencies, major non-profits, and global institutions situated in D.C., students here can train for the future alongside the leaders of today.

					One education major we surveyed summarized life at The University of Texas at Austin as ""research, education, and service."" Involving undergraduates in research is a core aspect of the faculty's mission, according to Associate Professor Julia Mickenberg: ""It's very important [for] undergraduates [to] recognize the value of working with professors who are doing cutting-edge research, because this is partly how they can fully comprehend that knowledge is itself constructed and always evolving, and they are learning not just information but how to build knowledge. I'm also modeling an attitude of inquiry for the students…I've found that they're very interested, and also excited to know that they're learning from teachers who are also scholars. I'm also constantly trying to get students themselves into the archives, and to find way for them to get a sense of the thrill that comes from discovering new material and/or finding new connections between things that had always been seen as unrelated."" As an example, the Freshman Research Initiative, which offers first-year students the opportunity to initiate and engage in authentic research experiences with faculty and graduate students in areas such as chemistry, biochemistry, nanotechnology, molecular biology, and computer science, is one such research opportunity for UT Austin students. Roughly 900 first-years participate in the Freshman Research Initiative, which guides students through the process of producing independent, potentially publishable research projects.

			The Jeanne Clery Act requires colleges and universities to disclose their security policies, keep a public crime log, publish an annual crime report and provide timely warnings to students and campus employees about a crime posing an immediate or ongoing threat to students and campus employees.
		
		
			Please visit The Princeton Review’s page on campus safety for additional resources: http://www.princetonreview.com/safety
		
		
			The Princeton Review publishes links directly to each school's Campus Security Reports where available. Applicants can also access all school-specific campus safety information using the Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis Cutting Tool provided by the Office of Postsecondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education: http://ope.ed.gov/security",,,,,,,"University of Connecticut students graduate ready to tackle the world. According to PayScale.com, the average starting salary for UConn alums is $55,400 and the average mid-career salary is an impressive $99,200. Of course, this isn't too surprising given that the Center for Career Development primes them for success. To begin with, undergrads can receive one-on-one counseling from a career consultant. This helps them create targeted goals and strategies. Students can also participate in the UConn Internship and Co-op Programs, which provide realworld work experience and plenty of opportunities for networking. In addition, the Center does a phenomenal job attracting companies for both career fairs and on-campus recruiting. Corporations that have been known to recruit UConn students include United Airlines, Half Full Brewery, and Mass Mutual.","

Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, CT (north of Hartford) is approximately 40 miles from campus. Public transportation from the airport to campus is inconvenient and expensive; you must take a bus or taxi to Hartford, then another bus or taxi to Storrs via Willimantic. A rental car is a better alternative. Private limousine services include the Horizon Airport Shuttle (860-429-8002) and the Airport Shuttle (860-450- 2170). Call for rates and reservations.

Driving Instructions to Campus:
From the north and south, take I-91 to I-84 in Hartford. Take I-84 northeast to Exit 68, then take Connecticut Rte. 195 S. to Storrs and the campus. Turn right on North Eagleville Rd. and turn left onto North Hillside Rd. Park in the north parking garage (fee charged).  Tours begin in the visitor's center on the corner of N. Eagleville and N. Hillside Roads. The admissions office is located 1 block past the parking garage on Hillside Road. From Boston, take I-84 southwest to Exit 70; then take Connecticut Rte. 32 S. to Connecticut Rte. 195; take Rte. 195 S. to Storrs. From Providence, take U.S. 44 W. to Rte. 195, then 195 S. to Storrs.

Local Accommodations:
On campus hotel services located at the Nathan Hale Inn (860-427-7888) or nathanhaleinn.com.  If you prefer a standard motel, try the Best Western (Rtes. 195 and 6; 860-423-8451), 15 minutes from campus. Here you will find the usual amenities and, in addition, an adjacent shopping mall. Or consider the Quality Inn and Conference Center (51 Hartford Tpke., Vernon; 860-646-5700 or 1-800-228-5151), right off I-84 at Exits 63 and 64."

					For their senior year, WPI students work on the equivalent of a senior capstone project known as the Major Qualifying Project (MQP). These are high-level design or research-based projects that students complete in their chosen field of study. Many students work in small teams to complete their MQP, under the advisement of a faculty member. One industrial engineering major notes that working in teams ""encourages cooperation among students rather than cut-throat competition."" In keeping with WPI's emphasis on hands-on learning and the fact that MQPs are focused on design and research, students often get the opportunity to work alongside faculty members in state-of-the-art research labs. It's not uncommon for students to complete their MQP at one of WPI's many centers away from the main Massachusetts campus and, because of WPI's reputation for exemplary performance on-the-job, a good number of these projects are completed with corporate sponsorship. An associate professor of mechanical engineering tells us, ""We hear from so many employers that our graduates are self-starters."" She explains, ""During four years at WPI they not only become highly knowledgeable in a discipline, they develop skills and competencies related to teamwork (they work in a variety of teams and most learn to identify and manage conflict in teams); problem solving (they're able to ask the right questions, scope problems, manage complex projects and get things done); and ‘learning to learn'—figuring out what they need to learn and jumping right in."" The schools says that it consistently has a 90 percent job and/or graduate school placement rate upon graduation with students receiving job offers from Amazon, Microsoft, Bose, Dow Chemical, Google, Pfizer, Sikorsky, EMC Corporation, and ExxonMobil, to name a few.

Of course, this should probably be expected. After all, a Middle Eastern studies major emphatically tells us that, “Career Services is awesome.” And many undergrads are able to land “amazing internships.” One thrilled journalism major confirms this stating, “I work at NBC in 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and will continue my internship for my last semester.” Numerous students attribute this success to Career Service's robust internship and co-op program. Beyond internships, the office also hosts a massive fall career fair featuring over 250 companies from a variety of industries as well as government and nonprofit organizations. And undergrads are also privy to a bevy of career events—including everything from drop-in resume clinics to sixty-minute job search boot camps. Finally, prospective (and current!) students should be pleased to discover that, according to PayScale. com, the average starting salary for a Rutgers alum is $58,900.","

DescriptionIn order to best serve our students and their families, we have established a partnership with both CDW and Apple that allows students to purchase high-quality laptops and accessories at discounted prices. You will find that the laptops offered through this program may cost a little more than discounted, consumer-class computers. University students carry their laptops to classes in backpacks, use them in the library and in student dining, and generally count on them to last for at least three to four years of heavy use. Commercial-grade laptops are much more durable and resistant to breakage. Their components are better as well.The laptops offered through the partnership with CDW and Apple are much more likely to endure the heavy use of college life, including constant transport and use. Although a bit more costly, experience has consistently shown that the computers offered through this program represent a better long term investment for students and their families.","http://www.stevens.edu/sit/police

					Similar to a senior thesis, all seniors at Stevens, regardless of their major, are required to complete a Senior Capstone Project. All of these projects are shown at the annual Innovation Expo, an event that's open to the Stevens community and the general public. Seniors are encouraged to develop their Capstone Projects with the collaboration of an industrial sponsor, providing another route for students to secure post-college employment. The Capstone Project, whether you're an electrical engineer, an information systems major, or a visual arts and technology student, should be seen as the culminating experience of a particular program of study and stem both from personal interest and future career goals. Students are assigned Capstone advisers to help guide them through the process of writing their reports and presentations and preparing their projects for exhibition. For one 2014 graduate, who pursued a dual bachelor's/master's degree in mechanical engineering and engineering management, respectively, her senior Capstone Project consisted of the rigorous solar decathlon, which spanned two years. ""Anyone can learn math calculations and science information,"" she says, ""but being able to get that information across within a group and have it be successful and optimized is another skill."" Several projects that were conceived in the classroom have gone on to become full-fledged businesses. Senior Capstone joins a plethora of hands-on learning opportunities at Stevens, including The Stevens Career Center's Cooperative Education Program, the engineering Design Spine curriculum, and the newly launched Stevens Venture Center. The strategy seems to be a hit. According to the most recent career outcomes report, within six months of graduation, 96 percent of the graduating class had secured their intended outcome in fields of their choice.

While these centers are linked through a main Career Services office, the majority of the services available at U of M, such as advising, career fairs, and job search tools, are offered through the individual colleges. As such, “academic advising and career services differ from college to college,” but most students seem to be pleased with the quality of what is offered. One student reports that “my advisor and the career center are excellent guides,” and another states that, “I'm always getting emails [from] the career center, all on-campus jobs offer training for finding jobs after graduation, and the information on post grad options are extremely easy to find.” There are also resources available specifically for women, LGBT students, international students, and other demographic groups. According to the school, U of M alumni have founded over 19,000 companies. Out of graduates visiting PayScale.com, 52 percent report feeling as though they derive a high level of meaning from their careers.","

Many undergrads benefit from having professors who “use their contacts with employers to help students land internships and job interviews.” They may also tap into a very “involved alumni network.” Further, a number of “job opportunities” come through TCU's fantastic Center for Career & Professional Development. Indeed, the office sponsors multiple career fairs throughout the year, each focused on a different discipline (ex. nursing, social work, engineering and technology, etc.) And it hosts a number of networking events wherein students can meet employers from various industries like criminal justice, media and interior design.

					Students in all disciplines have opportunities for research, thanks to Binghamton University's emphasis on faculty research. Associate Professor of Organizational Management Shelley Dionne explained the value of the school's focus: ""The whole purpose of placing research faculty in the classroom is to keep the curriculum fresh and up-to-date and, I should add, to bring an aura of discovery into the classroom. Our faculty do this. Many also recruit students to assist in their research, in which case research and pedagogy blend rather seamlessly."" Binghamton doesn't believe that research experience should wait until junior or senior year. Through the Freshman Research Immersion, students in science and engineering programs earn course credit as they work directly with faculty on cutting-edge research projects. Binghamton also sponsors a Summer Research Immersion (SRI) program for students majoring in the STEM fields. The two-course summer program give students time to learn research techniques, acquire background on a research question and follow through on the initial phases of a real research problem. The Summer Scholars and Artists Fellowship program gives students the freedom (and funding!) to conduct eight weeks of full-time research, scholarship, or creative activity over the summer. As Janice McDonald, Director of the Undergraduate Research Center, explains: ""Many of our students need to work; they simply can't take the summer off to do research. The Summer Scholars and Artists Program gives them time to pursue a topic they have proposed."" Throughout the process, students work closely with a faculty mentor and present their results at a poster session during Binghamton's annual Research Days. Past research projects have run the gamut from producing films and writing novels to studying Crohn's disease or examining health conditions in Vanuatu, an island in the South Seas. ""Students tell us at the end of the summer, it's one of the scariest things they've ever done, and sometimes it's one of the hardest things they've ever done, but it's also one of the most rewarding,"" McDonald says.

And many students happily report that there are “countless opportunities for internships.” This sunny outlook can certainly be attributed to the tireless efforts of DU's career services office. For starters, the office hosts multiple fairs throughout the academic year, including an innovative reverse career fair where students set up tables and employers circulate the room to share their job opportunities. Moreover, the office recently launched AlumniFire, which helps current students connect with Denver alums. And many students love to take advantage of the Career Center's drop-in program which allows them to swing by the office and quickly meet with a career advisor. ","

And the average starting salary of San Diego alumni is $54,400. This success can partially be attributed to a great career services team that really helps students cull together an actionable career development plan. With their assistance and keen advice, students find amazing positions at companies such as Wells Fargo, 20th Century Fox Film, Ernst & Young, Teach for America, Amazon, Boeing, and the San Diego Padres.","

					RIT is laser-focused on ""creating students that are more than prepared to enter the job force."" In fact, the RIT Class of 2015 boasts an enviable 95 percent undergraduate outcomes rate—the percentage of graduates who have entered the workforce, enrolled in further study, or are pursuing alternative plans (like military or volunteer service). RIT alumnus Tad Hunt (‘97) explains, ""The RIT name is synonymous with folks that just ‘Get Stuff Done.'"" That reputation is due, in part, to the fantastic cooperative education program that RIT offers. In 2015, more than 4,400 students completed nearly 6,000 co-op assignments with approximately 2,300 employing organizations. These assignments were located in fifty states and forty different countries. According to Tad Hunt, who majored in computer science, these experiences makes all the difference: ""RIT offered the best opportunity to gain both the theoretical and practical ‘feet on the ground' training through classes, co-op, and the self directed projects we did at Computer Science House,"" one of seven special interest residential houses on campus. While cooperative education schedules vary by department at RIT, most students alternate between academic classwork periods and full-time work periods in their field some time during the last three years of school, for a cumulative year of work experience. One student explains, ""[RIT's] cooperative education is highly advantageous and offers students great insight into the field of their choosing in order to get a better feel for the work environment and culture prior to diving in head first without reviewing all options first.""

The following guidelines are provided in the interest of assuring that documentation is appropriate to verify eligibility and to support requests for reasonable accommodations, academic adjustments, and/or auxiliary aids. The learning specialist in SDS is available to consult with diagnosticians regarding any of these guidelines.
Testing must be comprehensive. It is not acceptable to administer only one test for the purpose of diagnosis or establishing that substantial limitation in a major life activity currently exists in individuals with a previous diagnosis of LD. Minimally, domains to be addressed must include (but not be limited to):
Aptitude: Appropriate assessment instruments include: The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale­ III (WAIS-III); The Woodcock Johnson Psychoeducational Battery-III (WJ-III): Tests of Cognitive Ability; and The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale: 4 th Edition. All assessments must include subtest scores.
Achievement: Current functioning levels in reading, mathematics, and written language are required. Appropriate assessment instruments include: The Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery-III: (WJ-III) Tests of Achievement; Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-II; (WIAT II) Stanford Test of Academic Skills (TASK); Test of Written Language-3 (TOWL-3).
Information Processing: Specific areas of information processing (e.g. short-term and long­ term memory; sequential memory; auditory and visual perception/processing; processing speed) must be assessed. Appropriate assessment instruments include information from subtests on the WAIS-Ill, the WJ-III Tests of Cognitive Ability, or the Detroit Tests of Learning Aptitude-Adult (DTLA-A) as well as other instruments relevant to the presenting learning problem(s) may be used to address these areas.
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list or to restrict assessment in other pertinent and helpful areas such as vocational interests and aptitudes.
Testing must be current. In most cases, this means testing that has been conducted within the past three years. Because the provision of all reasonable accommodations and services is based upon assessment of the current impact of the student's disabilities on his/her academic performance, it is in a student's best interest to provide recent and appropriate documentation.
There must be clear and specific evidence and identification of a learning disability. Individual ""learning styles"" and ""learning differences"" in and of themselves do not constitute a learning disability.
Actual test scores must be provided. Standard scores are the preferred measurement; although percentiles and grade equivalents may used only if accompanied by standard scores. This is important since certain university policies and procedures (e.g. petitioning for permission to substitute courses) require actual data to substantiate eligibility.
In addition to actual test scores, interpretation of results is required. Test protocol sheets or scores alone are not sufficient.
Professionals conducting assessment and rendering diagnoses of learning disabilities must be qualified to do so. Trained, certified, and/or licensed school psychologists, neuropsychologists, clinical psychologists, learning disabilities specialists, and other professionals with training and experience relevant to adults and their evaluation are typically involved in the process of assessment. Experience working with the adult population is essential.
Tests used to document eligibility must be technically sound (i.e. statistically reliable and valid) and standardized for use with an adult population.
Diagnostic reports must include the names, titles, and professional credentials (e.g. licensed psychologist) of the evaluators as well as the date(s) of testing. All reports must be typed. Handwritten scores or summary sheets are not acceptable.
A written summary of or background information about the student's relevant educational, medical, and family histories that relate to the learning disability must be included.
Any recommendation for an accommodation should be based on objective evidence of a substantial limitation to learning supported by specific test results or clinical observations. Reports should establish the rationale for any accommodation that is recommended, using test data to document the need.
A description of any accommodation and/or auxiliary aid that has been used at the secondary or postsecondary level should be discussed.
Individual Education Programs (IEP's) and Section 504 plans are useful but are not, in and of themselves, sufficient documentation to establish the rationale for accommodations.","Comprehensive Documentation
Documentation should be comprehensive and must include the following:
Evidence of Early Impairment
Relevant historical information is essential since ADHD is by definition, first exhibited in childhood and manifests itself in more than one setting.
Evidence of Current Impairment
In addition to providing evidence of childhood history of impairment, please also include evidence of ongoing impulsive/hyperactive or attentive behaviors that significantly impair functioning in two or more settings. Please also include diagnostic interviews including self-reports and third party sources.
Rule out of Alternative Diagnoses or Explanations
The evaluator must investigate and discuss the possibility of dual diagnoses and alternative or coexisting mood, behavioral, neurological and/ or personality disorders that may confound the diagnosis of ADHD.
Specific Diagnosis
The report must include a specific diagnosis of ADHD based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria The diagnostician should use direct language in the diagnosis and avoid using terms such as ""suggests"", ""is indicative of"", or ""attention problems"". Individuals who report only problems with organization, test anxiety, memory or concentration in selective situations do not fit the prescribed diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Please note that a positive response to medication by itself does not confirm a diagnosis, or does use of medication in and of itself either support or negate the need for accommodation.
Relevant Testing
Neuropsychological or psychoeducational assessment is important in determining the current impact of the disorder on the individual's ability to function in academically­related settings. The evaluator should objectively review and include within the evaluation report relevant background information to support the diagnosis. If grade equivalents are reported, they must be accompanied by standard scores and/or percentiles. Test scores or subtest scores alone should not be used as a sole measure for the diagnostic decision regarding ADHD. Selected subtest performance tests do not in and of themselves establish the presence or absence of ADHD. Checklists and/ or surveys can serve to supplement the diagnostic profile but in and of themselves are not adequate for the diagnosis of ADHD and do not substitute for clinical observations and sound diagnostic judgment. All data must logically reflect a substantial limitation to learning for which the individual is requesting the accommodation.","Calculator allowed in exams: Yes

The weight given to the individual’s description will be influenced by its clarity, internal consistency, and congruency with the professional’s observations and available external documentation.  However, if the student is unable to clearly describe how the disability is connected to a barrier and how the accommodation would provide access, the institution may need to request third party documentation.

The question is not whether a given condition is a “disability,” but how the condition impacts the student in the academic and non-academic environments here at University of Dayton.  A student’s specific accommodation needs may vary based upon the unique characteristics of the course, program, or requirement.  This requires a clear understanding of how disability impacts the individual to establish the reasonableness of the accommodation for the individual.  Third party information may not be necessary depending on the information gathered from the student.  However, if this information is available, the student is welcome to provide a copy for review.  In addition, if there are outstanding questions, disability staff may request the third party information for further clarity and connection between the information provided and the requested accommodation. 

Disability documentation should be current and relevant but not necessarily “recent.”  Disabilities are typically stable lifelong conditions. Therefore, historic information, supplemented by interview or self-report, is often sufficient to describe how the condition impacts the student at the current time and in the current circumstances.

					For those who are entrepreneurially inclined, hands-on programs run out of the School of Business Administration at University of Dayton have undergraduates making major decisions in everything from running campus businesses to investing millions of dollars of the University's endowment. Flyer Enterprises is a network of ten businesses across campus that are entirely student-run, meaning undergraduates are responsible for everything from hiring and firing to purchase orders and market research. The ArtStreet Café, The Blend (a coffee shop), and FE Storage are all student-run enterprises that answer to a Board of Directors. Dr. Bickford, who sits on the board, tells us, ""They've learned things in the classroom, and they've applied them beyond the classroom. But there is no textbook in the world that can prepare you for the types of things that happen in life."" Not every business succeeds either, which is another lesson. ""The students in this business have more than one product. One is that they have to provide a service and make a profit. But another product is the learning experience they get,"" Dr. Bickford says. The Davis Center is another student-run venture, this time tasked with providing ""the quality market and equity research needed to effectively manage the University's student-run undergraduate portfolio."" You read this correctly: The Flyer Investments, housed in the Davis Center, is a group of fifteen undergraduates who make all buy, sell, and hold decisions for a dedicated fund and report semi-annually to an Advisory Board. The Davis Center runs a leadership development program for a group of forty to fifty undergraduates interested in learning the ins and outs of real-world portfolio management tools. Flyer Investments is the capstone experience seminar that is responsible for decisions on more than $20 million of the University's investments. As a result of all their hands-on experience, including in-depth equity analysis, Dr. Bickford says that alumni of the program ""do really well getting jobs on Wall Street and in investment banking and other areas.""

If you work for your degree and earn it, participate in co-ops or internships (and the opportunities to do so are ample), you are almost guaranteed a job out of college.” Not all students have quite such high praise, saying that they wished there were “more internships etc. for majors that are not engineering.” But overall, Michigan Tech gets high marks, with students saying “the [school's] biggest strength is the Career Services…There is a fall and spring career fair so getting internships and co-ops is slightly better than other universities.” The Career Services department is “really helpful in working with you to find a job/internship/co-op.” During the month of the career fair, Michigan Tech also offers lots of informal events that make up CareerFEST, which helps prepare students for interviews, résumé-writing, and more.

Accessibility documentation is used to verify the nature and extent of the disability by identifying the current functional limitation(s) caused by the disability.

Documentation is not required until after a student is admitted, but providing documentation early can help ease the transition to the university setting. Accessibility documentation should be sent directly to Student Access Services and is welcome anytime.

Documentation can be faxed to 785-864-2817, emailed to achieve@ku.edu, or mailed to AAAC 1450 Jayhawk Blvd. room 22 Lawrence KS 66045

Documentation Guidelines
Credentials of the evaluator(s).
Formal documentation is provided by an appropriate, qualified professional. The professional's name, title, credentials and affiliation should be provided. The professional should have no personal relationship with the student.

Diagnostic statement identifying the disability.
The documentation must include a clear diagnostic statement that describes how the condition was diagnosed, provides information on the functional impact, and details the typical progression or prognosis of the condition.

Description of the diagnostic methodology used.
The documentation must include a description of the diagnostic criteria, evaluation methods, procedures, tests and dates of administration, as well as a clinical narrative, observation, and specific results. Where appropriate to the nature of the disability, having both summary data and specific test scores* within the report is necessary. Methods may include formal instruments, medical examinations, structured interviews, and performance observations.

Description of the current functional limitations.
The recency of documentation is critical to the establishment of the student's current functional limitations. Information on how the disabling condition(s) currently impacts the individual is useful for both establishing a disability and identifying possible accommodations. A combination of the results of formal evaluation procedures, clinical narrative, and the individual's self-report is the most comprehensive approach to fully documenting impact. The best documentation is thorough enough to demonstrate the extent of how a major life activity is substantially limited by providing a clear sense of the severity, frequency and pervasiveness of the condition(s).

Description of current and past accommodations, services and/or medications.
Comprehensive documentation should include a description of both current and past medications, support services, accommodations, auxiliary aids, and assistive devices including their effectiveness in mitigating functional impacts of the disability.

Recommendations for accommodations, adaptive devices, assistive services, compensatory strategies, and/or collateral support services.
Recommendations from professionals with a history of working with the individual provide valuable information for the documentation review and planning for academic accommodations. It is most helpful when recommended accommodations and strategies are logically related to functional limitations; if connections are not obvious, a clear explanation of their relationship can be useful in decision-making.

Note: FERPA regulations apply to all documentation sent to our office
Examples of assessment instruments for Learning Disabilities include:
WAIS-IV, WAIS-III, Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement, WIAT-II.

Through numerous employer information sessions and job fairs, students are able to meet and interview with representatives from hundreds of industries. In fact, the university often draws big name corporations such as Vanguard, Allstate Insurance Company, AmeriCorps, Macy's, the U.S. State Department, Honeywell, American Express, Deloitte and DISH Network. Students can easily prepare for these meetings (as well as their job hunts in general) via workshops offered by Career Development. Topics cover everything from resume writing to crafting the perfect LinkedIn profile. ","

					A recent ASU graduate sums it up succinctly: ""Lots of students, but lots of opportunities to succeed."" For especially motivated scholars looking for a more intimate university experience, there's the nationally-praised Barrett, The Honors College: ""[Barrett] is a small, close-knit community, while ASU has all the perks of going to a large university,"" says a student who is studying psychology and philosophy. With more than 700 National Merit Scholars, Barrett is a powerhouse for students looking for a challenge—and for individually tailored coursework and seminars, job and internship opportunities, study abroad programs, and access to 1,800 Honors faculty across all ASU colleges. Barrett is recognized as one of the nation's top producers of prestigious Fulbright Scholars, and its students regularly progress to graduate programs at top-tier and Ivy League schools. Alumna, Kathy Duffy Ybarra says, ""It is difficult to name just one valuable experience, but I believe it was a combination of the leadership and life experiences I was afforded at ASU. They gave me the confidence that I could do whatever I set my mind to."" And 2000 political science grad, Danelle Kelling, who returned to ASU for her law degree, explains the career launching potential of participating in student organizations on campus: ""Working with the Arizona Students Association and the ASU Student Government gave me the opportunity to see that students, working in collaboration with administrators and other stakeholders, could accomplish important changes in education, law and policy.  I learned that I had a voice as a leader, that I could contribute and make a difference.""

Disability Services collaborates with students to provide reasonable accommodations that are individualized and based on documentation, functional limitations, and a collaborative assessment of needs.  Criteria for the source, scope, and content of documentation varies with each individual situation.  Helpful information may include medical records, evaluations (e.g., psychological, psychoeducational, neuropsychological), comprehensive school records, or a detailed assessment from a healthcare provider.

Documentation is most helpful when it includes:
?	Credentials of evaluator or licensed professional in the field related to specific diagnosis or impairment.
?	Diagnostic information that identifies the impairment/disability, provides information about the functional impact on the student?s ability to participate in Mason?s educational programs and services, and details typical progression or prognosis of the condition.
?	A description of the diagnostic methodology used (e.g., criteria, methods, procedures, clinical narrative, observation, specific results).
?	A description of current and past accommodations, services, medications, auxiliary aids, assistive devices, and support services that are logically related to functional limitations.
Disability Services created the The Disability Determination Form (Forms page) in an effort to make the process of securing documentation from healthcare providers more efficient.  The form includes guiding questions about a disability and its impact on functional limitations.  This form is not required if you have other documentation consistent with the guidelines above.","Documentation ?

For example, all undergrads have access to CougLink, a great resource for job and internship postings. It can also be used to schedule appointments with career counselors and peruse upcoming events. And speaking of events, every semester the Career Center hosts a campus-wide expo that attracts upwards of 100 recruiters from a variety of industries.

					One education major we surveyed summarized life at The University of Texas at Austin as ""research, education, and service."" Involving undergraduates in research is a core aspect of the faculty's mission, according to Associate Professor Julia Mickenberg: ""It's very important [for] undergraduates [to] recognize the value of working with professors who are doing cutting-edge research, because this is partly how they can fully comprehend that knowledge is itself constructed and always evolving, and they are learning not just information but how to build knowledge. I'm also modeling an attitude of inquiry for the students…I've found that they're very interested, and also excited to know that they're learning from teachers who are also scholars. I'm also constantly trying to get students themselves into the archives, and to find way for them to get a sense of the thrill that comes from discovering new material and/or finding new connections between things that had always been seen as unrelated."" As an example, the Freshman Research Initiative, which offers first-year students the opportunity to initiate and engage in authentic research experiences with faculty and graduate students in areas such as chemistry, biochemistry, nanotechnology, molecular biology, and computer science, is one such research opportunity for UT Austin students. Roughly 900 first-years participate in the Freshman Research Initiative, which guides students through the process of producing independent, potentially publishable research projects.

And this does not go unnoticed by current students. As one senior boasts, “Many employers place Missouri S&T candidates at the top of their list.” A fellow senior concurs adding, “Missouri S&T provides a first class education and employers know the quality of student that graduates from this institution so finding a job is no problem at all!” Certainly, some of this professional achievement can be chalked up to a “fantastic” career services office. After all, the industrious individuals who work here put up some remarkable statistics. For starters, the office facilitates roughly 4,700 on-campus interviews a year. It also arranges approximately 3,330 job postings for Missouri S&T students and provides access to an additional 16 million job postings worldwide. And, as if that all weren't enough, according to PayScale. com, the median starting salary of S&T graduates is $65,200.","

As one thrilled undergrad explains, “Being here at UI, I've had the chance to meet many people in [my prospective] industry, which helped me land an internship at NASA JPL this past summer.” Beyond networking, students can turn to Career Services for interview tips and tricks, salary and benefit negotiations, help crafting cover letters and even career assessment tests.

Theme Housing",Disability Resource Center,For all students with disabilities,Linda Smith,No,No,"The term learning disabilities refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning, or mathematical abilities.  Adults with a diagnosis of LD must be of at least average intellectual functioning and exhibit a deficit in one or more of the following areas of neuropsychological functioning: auditory processing, visual processing, information processing speed, memory, spoken and written language skills, reading skills, mathematical skills, spatial skills, motor skills, abstract or general reasoning or executive functioning. 

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, individuals with learning disabilities are guaranteed certain protections and rights of equal access to programs and services.  In the interest of assuring that LD documentation is appropriate to verify eligibility and to support requests for accommodations, academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, the following guidelines have been adopted from the Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD) and established for Montclair State University.

I.	Qualifications of the Evaluator

Professionals conducting assessments, rendering diagnoses of learning disabilities, and making recommendations for appropriate accommodations must be qualified to do so.  Training and experiencing in working with an adult population is essential.  The following professionals would generally be considered qualified to evaluate specific learning disabilities: trained and certified and/or licensed psychologists, educational psychologists, learning disabilities specialists (LDTCs), and other professionals.

II.	Documentation

Testing needs to be comprehensive.  It is not acceptable to administer only one test for the purpose of diagnosis.  Minimally, the domains addressed must include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.	Aptitude:  A complete intellectual assessment with all subtests and standard scores reported.  The preferred instrument is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III.  
2.	Achievement:  Current levels of functioning in reading, mathematics, and written language are required.  A comprehensive academic achievement battery, with all subtests and standard scores reported, is essential.  The Woodcock-Johnson III is preferred.
3.	Information Processing: Specific areas of information processing (e.g., short- and long-term memory, sequential memory, auditory and visual perception/processing, processing speed) should be assessed.  Information from the Woodcock-Johnson III may be used to address these areas.

This is not intended to be an exhaustive list or to restrict assessment in other pertinent and helpful areas, such as vocational interests and aptitudes.  A complete WJ-III is also acceptable providing that it covers all of the above domains.

Testing must be current.  Because the provision of reasonable accommodations and services is based upon assessment of the current impact of the student’s disabilities on her/his academic performance at the postsecondary level, it is in the student’s best interest to provide recent and appropriate documentation.

III.	Substantiation of the Learning Disability

Documentation should validate the need for services based on an individual’s current level of functioning.  A comprehensive assessment battery and the resulting diagnostic report should include a diagnostic interview, assessment of aptitude, academic achievement, information processing, and a diagnosis.  

The evaluation must provide clear and specific evidence that a learning disability does or does not exist.  Individual “learning styles” and “learning differences,” in and of themselves, do not constitute a learning disability.  It is important to rule out alternative explanations for problems in learning such as emotional, attention or motivational problems that may be interfering with learning but do not constitute a learning disability.  The diagnostician is expected to use direct language in the diagnosis and documentation of a learning disability, avoiding the use of terms such as “suggests” or “is indicative of.”  If the data indicate that a learning disability is not present, the evaluator should state that conclusion in the report.

A well-written diagnostic summary based on a comprehensive evaluation is also a necessary component of the report.  The clinical summary should include:
1.	A written summary of background information about the student’s educational, medical, and family histories that relate to the learning disability;
2.	Demonstration that the evaluator has ruled out alternative explanations for academic problems as a result of poor education, poor motivation and/or study skills, emotional problems, attention problems, and cultural or language differences;
3.	Indication of how patterns in the student’s cognitive ability, achievement and information processing reflect the presence of a learning disability;
4.	Indication of the substantial limitation to learning or other major life activity presented by the learning disability and the degree to which it impacts the individual at the postsecondary level for which the accommodations are being requested; 
5.	Indication as to why specific accommodations are needed and how the effects of the specific disability are accommodated; and
6.	An addendum of scores.

The report should be printed on letterhead, signed and dated.  Credentials of the evaluator should be included.

IV.	Recommendations for Accommodations

The diagnostic report should include specific recommendations for accommodations, as well as an explanation as to why each accommodation is recommended.  A description of any accommodation or auxiliary aid that has been used at the secondary or postsecondary level should be discussed.  If no accommodations have been previously provided, a detailed explanation as to why none has been used and the rationale for the student’s current need for accommodations must be provided.

It is important to recognize that accommodation needs can change over time and are not always identified through the initial diagnostic process.  Conversely, a prior history of an accommodation does not, in and of itself, warrant the provision of a similar accommodation at the postsecondary level.  Final determination for providing appropriate and reasonable accommodations rests with the institution.","Each student requesting accommodations through the Disability Resource Center is required to submit documentation to verify eligibility under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).  As defined by Section 504 and the ADA, an individual with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits a major life activity, including learning.  Academic adjustments and other accommodations are implemented to provide equal access to college programs and services.

In order to establish eligibility as an individual with a disability, the student must submit documentation that is comprehensive, clearly specifies the presence of a disability, and is appropriate to the post-secondary setting.

Any specific recommendations for accommodations must be based on significant functional limitations and must be supported by the diagnostic assessment.  Accommodations and academic adjustments cannot be implemented until the student’s documentation meets these criteria.  Prior history of having received an accommodation does not, in and of itself, warrant or guarantee its continued provision.  An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or 504 Plan is not sufficient documentation of a disability.

Documentation for Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) must be from an appropriate professional with comprehensive training in differential diagnosis as well as direct experience working with adolescents and adults with ADD/ADHD.  Professionals considered qualified to evaluate and diagnose ADD/ADHD include clinical psychologists, neuropsychologists, psychiatrists, and other relevantly trained medical doctors, such as neurologists.  The diagnostic report should be typed and submitted on official letterhead with name, title, professional credentials, address, and phone/fax numbers of the evaluator.  The documentation must include:

•	A specific diagnosis of ADD or ADHD based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, date of the current diagnostic evaluation, and the date of the original diagnosis.
•	Evidence of current impairment.  An assessment of the individual’s presenting symptoms and evidence of current hyperactive or inattentive behaviors that significantly impair functioning must be provided.  
•	Relevant developmental, medical and medication history, a thorough academic history, and a review of prior psycho-educational test reports to determine whether a pattern of strengths or weaknesses is supportive of attention or learning problems should be included.
•	A summary of relevant assessment data that supports or refutes a diagnosis of ADD/ADHD. Diagnostic assessment must consist of more than a self-report.  Possible data sources include results from the Continuous Performance Test, the T.O.V.A., Trail Making Test, or a neuropsychological evaluation.  Assessments such as checklists and rating scales are valuable, but should not be used as the sole criterion for a diagnosis of ADD/ADHD.
•	Evidence of alternative diagnoses or explanations being ruled out.  The documentation must investigate and discuss the possibility of dual diagnoses and alternative or coexisting mood, behavioral, neurological, and/or personality disorders that may confound the ADD/ADHD diagnosis.
•	Neurological or psycho-educational assessment may be necessary in order to determine the current impact of the disorder on the individual’s ability to function in an academic setting and to establish eligibility for classroom accommodations, including alternative testing, note-takers, etc.  Such data should include subtest and standard scores.
•	An indication of whether or not the student was evaluated while on medication and the degree to which the prescribed treatment reduces the level or degree of impairment.
•	A clinical summary which: (a) indicates the substantial limitation to a major life activity posed by the disability, (b) describes the extent to which these limitations would impact the student in an academic setting, (c) suggests how the specific effects of the disability may be accommodated, and (d) states how the effects of the ADD/ADHD are mediated by the recommended accommodations.","Calculator allowed in exams: Yes

activities to qualified persons with disabilities. A qualified individual is a person who, with or without reasonable 
accommodations, can meet established criteria applied to all students for participation in campus programs and activities.
In order to determine if an individual is entitled to these protections the campuses of the University of Maine System 
require documentation that establishes the presence of a learning disability; and provides sufficient information to 
describe the likely impact of the learning disability on the individual’s participation in the learning process as well as 
other campus programs and activities.
Documentation consisting only of a diagnosis, case or chart note
s, and/or prescription notations is unacceptable. 
Copies of IEPs and Section 504 plans may be informative, but are not sufficient documentation to support accommodation.
Individuals conducting evaluation and rendering diagnosis must have appropriate qualifications. Documentation 
typically would be provided by certified and/or licensed school psychologists, clinical psychologists, 
neuropsychologists, learning disability specialists, or other professionals with specific certification and experience in 
the identification of learning disabilities. 
The University has final authority for determining accommodations. This decision is based on the nature of the course or program, and specifics of the individual?s disability-related needs. Accommodations do not include 
interventions that are remedial or needed for personal care or study. 
Documentation of a Learning Disability must include:
1.
Relevant Historical Information 
a.
A summary of background information includes relevant developmental, medical and 
educational histories.
2.
Testing
a.
Testing must be current, generally within the past three 
–
four years, in order that accommodations are 
appropriately suited to the current impact of the disability.
b.
Testing must be comprehensive. It is not acceptable to a
dminister only one test for the purpose of diagnosis 
or establishing that substantial limitation exists. Minimally, domains to be addressed must include but are not limited to:
i.Aptitude, information processing, 
ii.Achievement: Current levels of functioning in reading, mathematics and written and oral language are 
required. 
3. Scores
a.Standard scores are required in reporting test data. Percentiles and grade equivalents are inadequate by 
themselves. 
4.Interpretation and Diagnosis 
a.Test scores and other information gathered through the evaluation process should be synthesized by the 
evaluator and provide clear and specific evidence that a learning disability does or does not exist. Evidence of a substantial limitation to learning or other major life activity must also be provided. 
It is the clinician?s responsibility to make a clear diagnostic statement about the presence of a disability if it exists
. 
5.Recommended Accommodations
a.Suggestions for appropriate auxiliary aids or services
should be included. The documentation should provide 
a rationale substantiating the need for accommodation based on the impact of the disability. Description of 
accommodations and/or auxiliary aids used previously are informative, but past accommodations,
especially those used in a high school environment, will not necessarily be appropriate in a university setting. 
Accommodations that would fundamentally alter the essential nature of a course or program will not be 
implemented.
6.Identifying Information 
a.Documentation must include the name and professional title(s) of the evaluator as well as the date(s) of testing. Reports must be typed on letterhead and signed by the evaluator. Handwritten scores or summary sheets are not acceptable.","DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES FOR ATTENTION DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER 
(ADD/ADHD)
The campuses of the University of Maine System are committed to providing equal access to campus programs and activities to qualified persons with disabilities. A qualified individual is a person who, with or without reasonable 
accommodations, can meet established criteria ap
plied to all students for participation in campus programs and 
activities.
Students requesting accommodations 
from the University of Maine are required to submit documentation to verify eligibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.   
The eligibility requirements for disability accommodations for students with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
are:
1.Verification of diagnosis and severity of condition
2. Documentation of current significant functional limitations in an educational setting. 

The University has final authority for determining accommodations. This decision is based on the nature of the 
course or program, and specifics of the individual?s disability-
related needs. Accommodations do not include interventions that are remedial or needed for personal care or study. 
Accommodations are provided after documentation has been submitted to and approved by Student Accessibility
Services. To ensure the provision of reasonable and appropriate accommodations for students with Attention 
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or Attention Deficit Disorder the following information should be provided in the documentation.
1. Verification of Disability

Professional Credentials
Name, title, and professional credentials of the evaluator, including 
information about license or certification, area of specialization, employment, and state or province 
in which the individual practices. Professionals generally considered qualified to evaluate and diagnose ADHD/ADD have comprehensive training in differential diagnosis, psychiatric disorders and direct experience with adolescent or adult ADHD population, such as clinical psychologists, 
neuropsychologists, psychiatrists and other relevantly
-
trained medical doctors.
b.Currency of Report
The provision of reasonable accommodations and services is based upon assessment of the current impact of the disability on academic performance.   In most cases, this means that a diagnostic evaluation has been completed within the last three years.  Documentation older than three years may be acceptable under certain conditions on a case-by-case basis.
c. Diagnostic Statement
Provide a specific diagnosis of ADHD based on the DSM-V diagnostic criteria. 
The diagnosis must be stated directly and should not use such terms as suggests, is indicative of, or attention problems.
2. Assessment Criteria
a. Evidence of Developmental or Early Impairment
Include indicators establishing that symptoms of 
the disorder were present in childhood, or early adolescence and manifested in more than one setting
b. Developmental and Medical History
Include a developmental and medical history. 
c. DSM-V Symptoms
Include a summary of objective historical information substantiating the individual?s manifestations of DSM-V ADHD throughout childhood, adolescence and adulthood (to 
the present) in two or more settings, and how patterns of inattentiveness, impulsivity and/or hyperactivity have been used to determine the presence of ADHD. 
d. Rule Out Alternative Causes
Indicate that alternative psychological, medical or non
cognitive (e.g.; educational; cultural) explanations have been investigated and ruled out as causes for inattentiveness, impulsivity, hyperactivity and/or executive functioning. 
e. Medical Treatment
Provide relevant current medical history.  Indicate whether or not the individual was evaluated while on medication prescribed for the treatment of ADHD, and whether or not the prescribed treatment produced a positive response
3.Educational Impact
a.History of the type and degree of limitations to learning
Include a summary of objective historical 
information about the educational impact of the ADHD from child
hood to the present such as transcripts, report cards, teacher comments, tutoring evaluations, past psychoeducational testing, 
and other third party interviews.  The individual’s history of using academic accommodations should be documented.  If no history
exists, then an explanation should be included regarding why 
accommodations were not used, and why they are now needed.
b. Current educational impact
Specify how ADHD currently impacts the individual?s academic 
functioning. Document current and substantial limitation to learning for which the individual is requesting accommodation, including how the disability impacts course examinations (if 
accommodations are being requested in this area).
4. Accommodation recommendations and justifications
Indicate why specific accommodations are needed and how the effects of ADHD symptoms, as designated by the DSM-V, are mediated by the accommodations

Professional who has comprehensive training and direct experience with the adolescent
and adult populations with learning disabilities. For example, the following professions
would generally be considered qualified to evaluate specific learning disabilities, provided
that they have additional training and experience in the assessment of learning disabilities

in adolescents and adults: clinical or educational psychologists; school psychologists;
neuropsychologists; learning disabilities specialists; and medical doctors.
Documentation of a learning disability should be in the form of a letter, typed on the
Qualified Professional?s official letterhead and signed by the Qualified Professional, and
must include information meeting the Minimum Documentation Guidelines.","Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ? Students that are requesting aids or
adjustments because of an ADD/ADHD diagnosis are required to submit documentation
to enable SSD to determine whether their diagnosis meets the legal definition of
disability. A diagnosis of ADD/ADHD does not automatically qualify a student for
academic accommodations under the law. To receive reasonable academic
accommodations, the student must provide current documentation from a psychiatrist,
psychologist, or other Qualified Professional indicating that the disability substantially

					The University of Houston is providing multifaceted, integrated educational experiences for its students—crucial for today's job market, in which skills and ideas collide to make successful careers. To this end, the school has created six ""clusters"" to promote the cross-pollination of ideas. There's the Arts and Human Enrichment cluster, which explores different cultures and histories through visual art, music, dance, literature, and media. Students interested in hacking human health (for the better!) can study within the Bio-Med Sciences & Engineering cluster, while those who gravitate toward fostering cultural sensitivity and economic development through social work and education can select the Community Advancement & Education track. The Energy & Natural Resources cluster allows students to focus on environmental issues and alternative energy and the Nano-Materials students get to geek out on the material sciences. Finally, the Complex Systems/Space Exploration cluster aims for the stars—quite literally—by working on artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, neutron scattering, and advanced materials for use in space. ""There's a wide range of majors and many interdisciplinary systems, and many ties to local business and industry,"" a computer science major shared with us. ""There is [actually] a space architecture program in the College of Architecture, building on the synergy with NASA.""

True to its name, the center also offers guidance for women looking for service opportunities within existing organizations on and off-campus, and even offers funding for students looking to start their own initiatives.

					Many alumni we interviewed agree that Babson's renown in entrepreneurship drew them to the school; standing that is due, in part, to the internationally recognized immersion course, Foundations of Management and Entrepreneurship (FME). The program attracts many students to the College, including alumnus Ross Beyeler, the founder of Growth Spark, who was ""immediately hooked"" on the idea of starting a business his first year. In the yearlong FME program, the college loans teams of first-year students $3,000 to launch their own businesses under the tutelage of two dedicated faculty members. Students learn the ins and outs of entrepreneurship, marketing, accounting, organizational behavior, information systems, and operations, as well as the integrated role these functions play in a business. As part of their work, students also establish a partnership with a local social services agency. The team donates eighty hours of community service to their partner agency and all the profits from their business after paying back the college's initial loan. The value of this award-winning course is clear. Dr. Candida Brush, vice provost of global entrepreneurial leadership at Babson, explains, ""Because of this signature learning experience, our freshmen are ‘changed' because they have entrepreneurial skills by the end of their second semester."" Students recognize this value as well. ""I compare my education to what my peers are receiving at other schools, and feel very confident that I'm more than prepared to compete in the working world,"" a business administration major confides.

General documentation guidelines listed in Appendix D.

Documentation should reflect data collected within the past three years at the time of request for services or after the age of 18 so long as the documentation continues to represent current functioning.

Clear and specific identification of a learning disability must be stated. For example, the terms ?Learning styles? or ?Learning differences? are not synonymous with a learning disability.

Documentation of a developmental and educational history consistent with a learning disability.

Documentation of learning disabilities should include standardized measures of academic achievement, cognitive/linguistic processing, and/or intellectual functioning that have normative data representing the general population. All standardized measures must be represented by standard scores and percentile ranks based on published age-based norms.

Documentation of one or more cognitive/linguistic processing deficits that is associated in a meaningful way with the identified area(s) of academic limitation. Cognitive/linguistic processes commonly associated with academic achievement (selection dependent upon case) include the following:

Fluency/Automaticity
Executive functioning
Memory/Learning
Oral Language
Phonological Processing
Orthographic Processing
Visual-Motor
Visual-Perceptual/Visual-Spatial
Documentation suggesting that the academic limitations are unexpected is necessary. As a result, evidence that substantially limited areas of achievement fall significantly below higher-level cognitive and/or linguistic abilities (e.g., broad intellectual functioning, reasoning, vocabulary, crystallized knowledge) must be included.

Objective (quantitative and qualitative) evidence that symptoms are associated with significant functional impairment in the academic setting. In the case of Learning Disabilities, documentation must include evidence of substantial limitation(s) in one or more of the following areas of academic achievement:

Reading (decoding, fluency, and/or comprehension)
Mathematics (calculations, math fluency, and/or applied reasoning)
Written Language (spelling, fluency, and/or written expression)
Academic impairments, processing deficits, and evidence of intact functioning in other domains (e.g., higher-level cognitive functioning), should be evident on multiple measures.

Documentation that alternative explanations for the academic and cognitive/linguistic limitation(s) have been considered and ruled out (e.g., low cognitive ability, other mental or neurological disorders, lack of adequate education, visual or auditory dysfunction, emotional factors such as anxiety or depression, cultural/language differences, poor motivation, symptom exaggeration).","Specific documentation guidelines for AD/HD include the following:

General documentation guidelines listed in Appendix D.

Documentation should reflect data collected within the past three years at the time of request for services.

A diagnosis consistent with the most recent DSM/ICD.

Evidence of the following diagnostic criteria must be included in the documentation:

Some evidence, beyond simple self-report, of clinically significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to the age of 12 (in accordance with the DSM). Possible data sources for evidence of early symptoms include the following: parent/guardian report, medical reports, school records, and past evaluations.
Evidence of current clinically significant symptoms of either inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be documented using appropriate standardized rating scales or norm-referenced measures of cognitive/executive functioning that provide comparisons to similarly aged individuals. However, in some cases, a detailed written statement from a qualified evaluator who has sufficient experience with the student and the student?s symptom history may be sufficient.
Symptom presence must be assessed using student self-report and corroborated by an independent informant who has been able to observe the student?s recent functioning.
Current clinically significant symptoms must be present in at least two settings and interfere with social, academic, or occupational functioning.
Verifiable evidence that symptoms are associated with significant functional impairment in the academic setting. Suggested sources for evidence of academic functional impairment include the results of a comprehensive psycho-educational evaluation, school records, and/or a comprehensive clinical interview that is described in a written statement by the evaluator.","Calculator allowed in exams: Yes

and possesses expertise in the disability for which modifications or accommodations are sought. Documentation must provide evidence of a disability, and the evaluation must have occurred after the student reached the age of 13.

A school plan such as an IEP or 504 Accommodation Plan is insufficient documentation. Testing instruments normed for use with adults are preferred. A history of accommodations does not in itself warrant the provision of similar accommodations at the UA. The final determination of appropriate and reasonable accommodations rests with The University of Alabama. Documentation must include, but is not limited to, the following elements:
1. DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW
The interview must relate a description of the presenting problem(s); developmental, medical, psychosocial and employment histories; family history (including primary language of the home
and the student?s current level of English fluency); a discussion of comorbidity where indicated; and relevant information regarding the student?s academic history.
2. ASSESSMENT
For the neurological or psychological evaluation to illustrate a substantial limitation to learning, the comprehensive assessment battery must address the following domains:
(a) Aptitude / Cognitive Ability An assessment of global intellectual functioning is required, as measured by the latest
version of one of the following acceptable instruments. Subtest and standard scores must be reported:
? Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). The WAIS is the preferred
instrument.
? Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Ability (WJIV)
? Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (SB5)
Unacceptable Instruments
? Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) ? this instrument is not
standardized for use on adults, but will be considered on a case-by-case basis
(b) Academic Achievement
A comprehensive achievement battery with subtest and standard scores, indicating
current level of functioning in the academic areas of reading, math, oral and written
language, must be included, as measured by the latest version of one of the following achievement batteries:
? The Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery Tests of Achievement (WJIV
ACH)
? Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT)
? Stanford Test of Academic Skills (TASK)
? Scholastic Abilities Test for Adults (SATA)
? Specific achievement tests such as the Test of Written Language (TOWL),
Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests ? Revised, or the Stanford Diagnostic
Mathematics Test.
Unacceptable Instruments
2 Documentation requirements
Specific Learning Disabilities
? The Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT)
? Mini Battery of Achievement (MBA)
(These are not comprehensive measures of achievement and are therefore not suitable for documentation purposes at UA.)
(c) Information Processing
To address the specific areas of short and long-term memory, sequential memory, auditory and visual perception, processing speed, executive function, and motor ability, a comprehensive battery with subtest and standard scores must be administered.
? Information from the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Ability, the WAIS,
or the Detroit Tests of Learning Aptitude ? Adult (DTLA-A), as well as other instruments relevant to the presenting learning problem(s) may be used to address these areas.
3. DIAGNOSIS
A clear and specific statement that the student is diagnosed with a learning disability and the accompanying DSM-V diagnostic code(s) are required to determine eligibility for services.
4. CLINICAL SUMMARY
(a) The substantial limitations to major life activities posed by the specific learning
disability, and the extent to which these limitations impact the academic context for
which accommodations are being requested.
(b) Suggestions as to how the specific effects of the learning disability may be
accommodated.
(c) Rationale for such accommodations. Any recommendation for an accommodation
should be based on objective evidence of a substantial limitation to learning, supported
by specific test results and clinical observations. Reports should establish the rationale
for any accommodation that is recommended, using test data to document the need.
5. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
(a) Interpretation of results is required. Test protocol sheets, handwritten summary sheets or
scores alone are not sufficient.
(b) All reports must be in narrative format, typed, signed by the diagnosing clinician, and must
include the names, titles and professional credentials (e.g., licensed psychologist) of the
evaluators as well as the date(s) of testing.

credentialed and possesses expertise in the disability for which modifications or accommodations are sought. Documentation must provide evidence of a disability, and the evaluation must have occurred after the student reached the age of 13.

A school plan such as an IEP or 504 Accommodation Plan is insufficient documentation without the background information from which the plan was written. Testing instruments normed for use with
adults are preferred. A history of accommodations does not in itself warrant the provision of similar accommodations at the UA. The final determination of appropriate and reasonable accommodations rests
with The University of Alabama. Documentation must include, but is not limited to, the following elements:
1. EVIDENCE OF IMPAIRMENT
(a) Early - The condition must have been exhibited in childhood in more than one setting.
(b) Current ? Presenting symptoms, evidence of current impulsive / hyperactive or inattentive behaviors that significantly impair functioning in two or more settings, must be discussed.
2. DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW
Include self-report and third-party (i.e., other than the student) information pertaining to developmental history, relevant medical and medication history, a thorough academic history, and a review of prior reports to determine whether a pattern of strengths or weaknesses is supportive of attention or learning problems.
3. EVIDENCE OF ALTERNATIVE DIAGNOSES OR EXPLANATIONS OF RULE OUT
The possibility of dual diagnoses and alternative or coexisting mood, behavioral, neurological and/or personality disorders that may confound or be the primary cause of attentional difficulties
must be addressed and ruled out.
4. DIAGNOSIS
(a) A clear and specific statement that the student is diagnosed with ADHD as per the DSM-V (including diagnostic codes). Primary and secondary Axis I and Axis II diagnoses are required.
(b) Description of symptoms related to the diagnosis which indicate the nature, frequency and severity of the symptoms that the student experiences.
(c) Date of original diagnosis, if known, and last contact with the student.
5. MEDICATION
Prescribed medications, dosages, schedules and side effects that may influence the type of accommodations provided should be addressed. Medication alone cannot be used to support a diagnosis.
2 Documentation requirements

					Audrey Murrell, the associate dean for the undergraduate College of Business Administration, told us that Pitt students ""are comfortable working in teams, sharing knowledge with their classmates, actively engaging in our various…student organizations and value what it means to be part of a broader university community."" It's no accident that Pitt has a number of programs that help cultivate collaborative skills. While these abilities help make fun and engaging learning environments, they are also key to launching a successful career. This skill set ""is an attractive asset for our corporate recruiters who look at students who can balance a strong academic program with healthy involvement in activities outside classrooms,"" Dr. Murrell told us. For example, Pitt's Outside the Classroom Curriculum offers an expansive array of opportunities and experiences divided among ten different goal areas, including leadership, career development, wellness, appreciation of the arts, and others, all with the express purpose of helping students ""gain a competitive edge for graduate or professional schools, internships, and the job marketplace,"" according to the university. The OCC works under the assumption that 80 percent of a student's time will be spent outside of the classroom during their undergraduate education and that the school should create out-of-the classroom experiences and opportunities that complement educational and career goals. Students who complete the Outside the Classroom Curriculum by participating in all ten categories are able to graduate with distinction and are eligible for a Pitt Advantage Grant, which provides funding for students to continue ""extracurricular involvement in the form of an experiential learning activity such as a study abroad experience, an unpaid internship, or a volunteering project."" As an example, to complete the global and cultural awareness goal, students must participate in a diversity or social justice program, participate in an international program, and attend a seminar about ecological issues.

Starting from freshman year, the office works to empower students and help them plot their career goals. Undergrads can take advantage of a plethora of recruiting and networking events held on campus each year. More specifically, students have the opportunity to meet with representatives from companies/organizations like the Central Intelligence Agency, The Hershey Company, Lockheed Martin and the Nielsen Company (among others).
